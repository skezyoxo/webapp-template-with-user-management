# Next.js Web Application Template with User Management

This is a modern web application template built with Next.js, featuring user management and database integration. It includes:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 14 with App Router
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for database ORM
- PostgreSQL support (with flexible hosting options)
- User authentication and management
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js installed (v18 or later)
- Access to a PostgreSQL database (self-hosted or cloud provider)
- Git for version control

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd [your-repo-name]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Database Setup:
   You'll need a PostgreSQL database. Here are some options:

   #### Option 1: Using Neon (Serverless PostgreSQL)
   - Create a project at [Neon](https://neon.tech)
   - Copy your connection string
   
   #### Option 2: AWS RDS
   - Set up a PostgreSQL instance on RDS
   - Use the provided endpoint and credentials
   
   #### Option 3: Self-hosted PostgreSQL
   - Install PostgreSQL on your server
   - Configure access credentials

   After choosing your database provider:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your database URL:
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?schema=public"
     ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
